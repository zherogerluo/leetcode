#### Shortest paths problems:
* BFS is usually the way to go as it guarantees the shortest path

#### Tree problems:
* Can be almost always solved by recursion
* Be fluent in writing pre-/post-/in-order traversals both recursively and iteratively

#### Sub array problems:
* See if it could be solved using accumulated value from array head and taking diff
