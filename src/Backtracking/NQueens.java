/**
 * LeetCode #51, hard
 *
 * The n-queens puzzle is the problem of placing n queens on an n√ón chessboard such that no two queens attack each other.

 Given an integer n, return all distinct solutions to the n-queens puzzle.

 Each solution contains a distinct board configuration of the n-queens' placement, where 'Q' and '.' both indicate a
 queen and an empty space respectively.

 Example:

 Input: 4
 Output: [
 [".Q..",  // Solution 1
 "...Q",
 "Q...",
 "..Q."],

 ["..Q.",  // Solution 2
 "Q...",
 "...Q",
 ".Q.."]
 ]
 Explanation: There exist two distinct solutions to the 4-queens puzzle as shown above.

     * Solution 1: Backtracking
     *
     * Put Queen LINE BY LINE, each Queen will occupy a row (already enforced), a column, and two diagonals. Put one
     * at a position only if its column and two diagonals have not been occupied. Once completing the last row, we
     * know we have a valid solution.
     *
     * The most important thing to note is, for each row there has to be only one Queen. By implementing this, we can
     * reduce time complexity from naive backtracking's O((n^2)!) to O(n!).
     *
     * Another important note is that, to verify if a position can be taken, naively we can start from that position
     * and search 8 directions to the edge of the board. However this search will take O(n) time. A better algorithm
     * would be, to keep a boolean map (array) for every column (total of n) and diagonals (total of 2 * n - 1 for +-
     * 45 degrees each). This reduces the search to O(1) time.
     *
     * Time complexity: O(n!). Space complexity: O(n).
